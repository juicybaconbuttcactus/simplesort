SimpleSort
==========

This is an extremely simple C++ program that will implement the various sorting algorithms
semi-efficiently, but most importantly, simply.

For now, I'm going to start with Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Heap, and Quick Sort.
Later, I'll probably do a quick implementation of Intro Sort.
